##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

To get and clean the raw data, I performed the following steps:
* Download and unzip files
* Parse and extract useful features and read corresponding data from raw data
* Parse the subject and activity data
* Combine the train data and test data
* Create a tidy data
* Create a tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
