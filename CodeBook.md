## Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This code book describes the variables and transformations made to clean the raw data

## Variables
* subject : ID of subject who performed the activity. Its range is from 1 to 30
* activity:  The specific activity that the subject performed

Other variables include:
